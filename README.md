## About the Project

**About Me**

This is an open-source docking station that I made around my January Break. I am in high school (recently got accepted to MIT) and I am learning Electrical Engineering, and I thought this would be a great project to expand my knowledge about a large number of connectors and protocols. I have designed a few other circuit boards before, but nothing as complex as this. I have made this project open-source so that anyone who needs a docking station can make their own, but mainly so that others learning electrical engineering can have a free reference design.
